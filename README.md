get_orbit
==============================
### An accademic demostration to solve the motion of a planet about the sun.
### Description
Solves the orbit of a planet about the sun. This is a demosntration problem (didactical). It solves the motion of the earth or any other planet about the sun.
It is assumed that the mass of the sun is large enough that the reduced mass is
the mass of the planet.
* To run, in the command line type: `python get_orbit.py`

### Inputs
The input values needed are the mass of the planet, initial location `(x,y)` and velocity `(vx,vy)` at an initial time assumed to be 0 day.
### Outputs
It generates a data file with trajectories and velocities. The total energy is calculated at every step to check how good the integration is. It also plot the trajectory in the xy plane. The sun is supposed to be at the origin.
