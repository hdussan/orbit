# orbit
Solves the orbit of a planet about the sun. This is a demosntration problem (didactical). It solves the motion of the earth or any other planet about the sun.
It is assumed that the mass of the sun is large enough that the reduced mass is
the mass of the planet.
Only input values needed are the mass of the planet and the location and at velocity `(vx,vy)` at an initial time assumed to be 0 day.
